      <h2>üß† Why It Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Anno 1800's complexity is part of its beauty‚Äîbut it can also be overwhelming. This site was built by a fan of
        the game (and spreadsheets) who wanted a faster, more intuitive way to make production planning fun instead of
        frustrating. If you've ever asked yourself ‚ÄúWhy do I still have a soap shortage?‚Äù‚Äîthis tool is for you.
