      <h2>üß† Why It Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Anno 1800's complexity is part of its beauty‚Äîbut it can also be overwhelming. I originally used spreadsheets to
        plan out my islands and production chains, but as my empire grew, it became increasingly difficult to manage
        everything in a spreadsheet alone. This site was born out of that frustration‚Äîa fan-made tool to make production
        planning faster, more intuitive, and actually enjoyable. If you've ever asked yourself ‚ÄúWhy do I still have a
        soap shortage?‚Äù‚Äîthis tool is for you.

      <h2>üíæ Save Your Work</h2>
      <p>
        You can export your production data as JSON and re-import it later to continue exactly where you left off.
        There's also a manual edit feature for users who want to tweak or share their data directly.
